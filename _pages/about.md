Hi! I'm Ziyun, a Computer Science student at the University of Notre Dame. Balancing academics with extracurricular activities, I'm deeply engaged in my studies while also contributing to the university community. In addition to my coursework, I'm an active member of the Marching Band and the proud founder of the Video Game Development Club. Outside of academia, I spend my free time watching movies, playing piano, or making crafts.
